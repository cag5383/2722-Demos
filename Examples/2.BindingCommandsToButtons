There are four goals for this activity:
    Understand how to set up joystick buttons as Triggers.
    Understand how to use the LEDAdapter to change the LEDs
    Understand how to use the DriveAdapter to drive the robot
    Understand how to map subsystem commands to joystick buttons

1. Things to Read:
    BlinkIn/LEDAdapter.java
    Drive/DriveAdapter::DriveForward
    Drive/DriveAdapter::DriveStrafe
    Drive/DriveAdapter::DriveTurn
    JoystickConfigs/DriverController.java
    RobotContainer::configureDriverBindings

    Note: Above is shorthand that will be used consistently.
    Class::Method is used to specify the need to review a particular method(s) within a class,
    rather than the entirety.
    For example, the first line above would mean that you need to go to the DriveAdapter.java file
    and look for the DriveForward method.

2. An example is provided in RobotContainer::configureDriverBindings for mapping a button press to:
    a. Change the color of the LEDs to green when the A button is pressed.
    b. Drive the robot forward when DPad Up is pressed.

3. Exercise:
    a. Can you use the B, X, and Y buttons to change the LEDs to other colors available in LEDAdapter.java?
    b. Can you create the following additional drive commands and map them to the buttons specified below?
        DPad Down: DriveForwards Backwards (negative) at 0.5 speed.
        DPad Left: DriveStrafe Left (positive) at 0.5 speed
        DPad Right: DriveStrafe Right (negative) at 0.5 speed
        Left Bumper: DriveTurn Left (positive) at 0.5 speed
        Right Bumper: DriveTurn Right (negative) at 0.5 speed

4. Discussion
    What is the difference between OnTrue versus WhileTrue for Triggers/Buttons?
    What are examples of when you might want to use one over the other?
    When you drive forward, which direction does the robot drive in?
        Is forward towards the front of the robot or the front of the room?
